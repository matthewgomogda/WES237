## Overview

This lab assignment focuses on exploring the GPIO functionality of the PYNQ-Z2 board by utilizing the programmable logic (PL) and processing system (PS). The primary goals include understanding how the PL manages peripherals like LEDs, buttons, switches, and PMOD headers, and how some peripherals are directly controlled by the PS. The assignment also emphasizes interfacing with GPIO pins for sending and receiving data through MicroBlaze soft processors and Python.
